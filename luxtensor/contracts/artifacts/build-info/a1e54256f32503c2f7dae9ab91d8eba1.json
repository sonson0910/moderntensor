The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

@dev Interface of the ERC-20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[ERC-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC-20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":1196,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1196],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"2126:12:11","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":1164,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2145:850:11","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n -

@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract.

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC-20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Usage example: ```solidity contract Named {     using ShortStrings for *;     ShortString private immutable _name;     string private _nameFallback;     constructor(string memory contractName) {         _name = contractName.toShortStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);     }     function name() external view returns (string memory) {         return _name.toStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);     } } ```\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":\"ShortStrings\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1fcf8cceb1a67e6c8512267e780933c4a3f63ef44756e6c818fda79be51c8402\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://617d7d57f6f9cd449068b4d23daf485676d083aae648e038d05eb3a13291de35\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPADWPiGaSzZDFNpFEUx4ZPqhzPkYncBpHyTfAGcfsqzy\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcf74f855663ce2ae00ed8352666b7935f6cddea2932fdf2c3ecd30a9b1cd0e97\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://9f660b1f351b757dfe01438e59888f31f33ded3afcf5cb5b0d9bf9aa6f320a8b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmarDJ5hZEgBtCmmrVzEZWjub9769eD686jmzb2XpSU1cM\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol":{"StorageSlot":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60566037600b82828239805160001a607314602a57634e487b7160e01b600052600060045260246000fd5b30600052607381538281f3fe73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea264697066735822122080637b4cf8f58442afd5b19cbd15928226ab732381b221bc298e4f170f1c143264736f6c63430008140033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x56 PUSH1 0x37 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x2A JUMPI PUSH4 0x4E487B71 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH1 0x0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 DUP1 PUSH4 0x7B4CF8F5 DUP5 TIMESTAMP 0xAF 0xD5 0xB1 SWAP13 0xBD ISZERO SWAP3 DUP3 0x26 0xAB PUSH20 0x2381B221BC298E4F170F1C143264736F6C634300 ADDMOD EQ STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"1407:2774:24:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;-1:-1:-1;;;1407:2774:24;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea264697066735822122080637b4cf8f58442afd5b19cbd15928226ab732381b221bc298e4f170f1c143264736f6c63430008140033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 DUP1 PUSH4 0x7B4CF8F5 DUP5 TIMESTAMP 0xAF 0xD5 0xB1 SWAP13 0xBD ISZERO SWAP3 DUP3 0x26 0xAB PUSH20 0x2381B221BC298E4F170F1C143264736F6C634300 ADDMOD EQ STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"1407:2774:24:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
