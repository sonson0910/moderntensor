    Removes fake UTxOs from a Plutus smart contract on the Cardano blockchain.

    This function constructs and submits a transaction that consumes the specified fake UTxOs from a Plutus
    script and returns the total amount of lovelace (ADA in smallest unit) to the owner's address. The
    transaction is signed using the provided payment signing key, and any change (e.g., after accounting
    for fees) is returned to the owner's address.

    Args:
        payment_xsk (ExtendedSigningKey): The extended signing key used for the payment part of the transaction.
        stake_xsk (Optional[ExtendedSigningKey]): The extended signing key for staking, if applicable.
            If provided, the owner's address will include a staking component; otherwise, it will be omitted.
        fake_utxos (List[UTxO]): A list of fake UTxOs to be removed from the smart contract.
        script (PlutusV3Script): The Plutus script associated with the smart contract.
        network (Optional[Network]): The Cardano network to operate on (e.g., Network.TESTNET or Network.MAINNET).
            Defaults to `settings.CARDANO_NETWORK` if not provided.
        context (Optional[BlockFrostChainContext]): The blockchain context (e.g., BlockFrost API) for interacting
            with the Cardano network. Defaults to a function like `get_chain_context()` if not provided.

    Returns:
        TransactionId: The ID of the transaction submitted to the blockchain.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If essential inputs (e.g., `payment_xsk`, `fake_utxos`, or `script`) are invalid or missing.
        Exception: If the transaction fails to build or submit due to network issues or invalid data.
