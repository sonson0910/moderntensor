    Creates a UTxO with the specified amount of lovelace and datum locked into a Plutus smart contract.

    This function builds and submits a transaction that locks a given amount of lovelace into a Plutus script
    address, attaching the provided datum. The transaction is signed with the provided payment signing key,
    and any change is returned to the owner's address.

    Args:
        payment_xsk (ExtendedSigningKey): The extended signing key for payment.
        stake_xsk (ExtendedSigningKey): The extended signing key for staking (optional).
        amount (int): The amount of lovelace to lock into the UTxO (e.g., 2_000_000 for 2 tADA).
        script_hash (ScriptHash): The hash of the Plutus script (smart contract).
        datum (PlutusData): The datum (data) to attach to the UTxO.
        context (BlockFrostChainContext): The blockchain context for interacting with the Cardano network.
        network (Network, optional): The Cardano network to use (e.g., Network.TESTNET or Network.MAINNET).
                                     Defaults to settings.CARDANO_NETWORK if not provided.

    Returns:
        TransactionId: The ID of the transaction submitted to the blockchain.
