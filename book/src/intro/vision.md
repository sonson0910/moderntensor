# Vision: A Native AI Blockchain

The vision of ModernTensor is to create a **Verifiable Intelligence Internet** where:

1. **AI is a Public Utility**: Just as Ethereum made computation a public utility, ModernTensor makes *Machine Intelligence* a public utility.
2. **Trustless Intelligence**: Output from AI models can be trusted not because of *who* ran it, but because it was cryptographically verified (zkML).
3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Specialized models can compose together on-chain to solve complex problems.

## The Problem with Current AI

- **Centralization**: API access can be revoked anytime (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- **Opaque Weights**: "Black box" models with no transparency.
- **Censorship**: Central entities decide what prompts are allowed.

## The ModernTensor Solution

ModernTensor provides an immutable, permissionless substrate for AI:

- **Permissionless Access**: Anyone can submit a request.
- **Permissionless Provision**: Anyone can run a miner.
- **Incentivized Quality**: Better models earn more rewards.
