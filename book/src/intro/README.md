# Introduction

Welcome to **The ModernTensor Book**.

ModernTensor is a groundbreaking Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for **Decentralized AI**. It treats AI models and their outputs as first-class primitives, enabling on-chain inference, verification, and monetization without relying on centralized oracles or bridges.

## Why ModernTensor?

Traditional blockchains are great for financial transactions but struggle with complex computations like AI inference. Existing solutions often use:

- **Off-chain Oracles**: Slow, trust-dependent, and expensive.
- **Bridges**: Vulnerable to hacks and added latency.

ModernTensor solves this by embedding AI capabilities directly into the EVM via **Native AI Precompiles**.

## Key Features

- **Native AI Opcodes**: Call AI models directly from smart contracts (e.g., `AI_REQUEST` at `0x10`).
- **Proof of Verification**: zkML integration ensures AI outputs are correct without re-execution.
- **Pay-per-Compute**: A sustainable economic model where miners earn MDT tokens for computing, not just hashing.
- **High Performance**: Built on Rust, offering 10-100x performance over legacy Python implementations.

## Who is this book for?

- **Developers**: Build the next generation of AI dApps.
- **Validators**: Secure the network and earn rewards.
- **Miners**: Monetize your hardware and AI models.
- **Researchers**: Explore the intersection of AI and Blockchain.
