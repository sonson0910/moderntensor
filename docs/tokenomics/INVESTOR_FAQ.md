# ModernTensor Investor FAQ

## Investment Opportunity

### What is ModernTensor?
ModernTensor is a custom Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for decentralized AI workloads. It creates a permissionless marketplace for AI compute and model hosting, competing with Bittensor but with superior technology and economics.

### What stage is the project?
- **Development:** 83% complete
- **Testnet:** Live and operational
- **Mainnet:** Targeted Q1 2026 (2 months)
- **Funding Stage:** Seed round

### What is the investment opportunity?
We are raising $2-3M in seed funding via SAFE + Token Warrant structure. This funding will accelerate mainnet launch, team expansion, and ecosystem development.

## Market & Competition

### How big is the market?
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TAM (Global AI Infrastructure) | $200B by 2030 |
| SAM (Decentralized AI) | $15B |
| SOM (3-year target) | $150M |

### Who are the competitors?
| Competitor | Market Cap | ModernTensor Advantage |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| Bittensor (TAO) | $8B | 10x faster, better economics |
| Fetch.ai | $1B | Different focus (agents vs models) |
| Ocean Protocol | $500M | Complementary (data vs compute) |

### What's the moat?
1. **Custom L1 in Rust** — Performance advantage
2. **Adaptive tokenomics** — Sustainable economics
3. **First-mover** — Early to improved design space
4. **Developer experience** — 144-method SDK ready

## Token Economics

### What is the token?
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Name | ModernTensor Token (MDT) |
| Max Supply | 21,000,000 |
| Type | Utility + Governance |

### How does token distribution work?
| Allocation | Percentage | Vesting |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Emission Rewards | 45% | Earned over time |
| Ecosystem Grants | 12% | Milestone-based |
| Team | 10% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| Treasury | 10% | Governance controlled |
| Private Sale | 8% | 2-year vest, 6-month cliff |
| Foundation | 5% | Long-term |
| Liquidity | 5% | Day 1 unlock |
| IDO | 5% | Day 1 unlock |

### What makes the tokenomics special?

**Adaptive Emission:**
- Mints more when network is active
- Preserves supply when usage is low
- 72-99% less inflation than Bittensor

**Four Burn Mechanisms:**
1. Transaction fees (50% burned)
2. Subnet registration (100% burned)
3. Quality quota misses (100% burned)
4. Slashing penalties (50% burned)

**Net Result:** Can become deflationary as network grows.
