# ModernTensor Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## ModernTensor Announces Mainnet Launch: A New Era for Decentralized AI Infrastructure

*Custom Layer 1 blockchain delivers 10x performance improvement over existing decentralized AI networks*

---

**[CITY, DATE]** — ModernTensor, a pioneering project in decentralized artificial intelligence infrastructure, today announced the launch of its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of decentralized AI compute markets.

### The Challenge

The AI industry faces a critical infrastructure challenge. With Big Tech controlling over 70% of AI compute resources and GPU costs exceeding $10,000 per month, independent AI developers and researchers are increasingly locked out of meaningful participation in the AI revolution.

### The Solution

ModernTensor addresses these challenges with LuxTensor, a custom Layer 1 blockchain built from the ground up in Rust specifically for AI workloads. Unlike existing solutions that rely on modified general-purpose blockchains, LuxTensor achieves:

- **1,000-5,000 transactions per second** — 10x improvement over competitors
- **Adaptive token emission** — 72-99% less inflation than fixed-emission models
- **Zero entry barriers** — Anyone can participate without requiring existing tokens
- **Full EVM compatibility** — Easy migration for existing DApps and smart contracts

### Tokenomics Innovation

The ModernTensor Token (MDT) introduces four distinct burn mechanisms and adaptive emission that responds to network utility, creating sustainable long-term economics:

- **Max Supply:** 21,000,000 MDT
- **Emission:** Utility-based (mints more during high activity, preserves supply during low activity)
- **Burns:** Transaction fees, subnet registration, quality quotas, and slashing

### Technical Achievement

The ModernTensor team has completed 83% of core development, with over 7,550 lines of production Rust code and a comprehensive test suite of 143 tests achieving 100% pass rate. The testnet has been live and operational, demonstrating the platform's readiness for mainnet.

### Market Opportunity

The global AI infrastructure market is projected to reach $200 billion by 2030, with decentralized solutions representing the fastest-growing segment. ModernTensor is positioned to capture this opportunity with superior technology and sustainable economics.

### Availability

The ModernTensor mainnet is now live. Developers, validators, and AI model providers can participate through:
