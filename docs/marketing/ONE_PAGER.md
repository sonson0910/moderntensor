## In One Sentence

**ModernTensor is a custom Layer 1 blockchain optimized for decentralized AI workloads, offering 10x better performance and 72-99% less inflation than Bittensor.**

---

## The Problem

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **AI Compute Centralization** | Big Tech controls 72% of AI infrastructure |
| **High Barriers** | GPU costs exceed $10K/month for serious compute |
| **No Monetization** | <1% of AI creators earn income from their models |
| **Model Lock-in** | Proprietary APIs create vendor dependency |

---

## Our Solution

A ground-up blockchain built specifically for AI:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Custom L1 (Rust)** | 1,000-5,000 TPS vs 100 TPS |
| **Adaptive Emission** | Only mint when network is active |
| **4 Burn Mechanisms** | Deflationary pressure |
| **Zero Entry Barrier** | Anyone can participate |
| **Full EVM** | Easy DApp migration |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Market** | $200B AI compute by 2030 |
| **Progress** | 83% complete |
| **Status** | Testnet live |
| **Mainnet** | Q1 2026 |
| **Raise** | $2-3M Seed |

---

## Tokenomics ($MDT)

- **Max Supply:** 21M tokens
- **Emission:** Adaptive (0-2,876/day vs Bittensor's fixed 7,200/day)
- **Burns:** Transaction fees, registration, slashing, quotas
- **Staking:** 6-25% APY based on tier
