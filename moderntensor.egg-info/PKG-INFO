# ModernTensor CLI

ModernTensor is a project focused on building a command-line interface (CLI) tool to support programming and deploying tensor models in modern applications. The project is currently in its early development stage and there are still many areas that need to be completed.

![moderntensor.png](https://github.com/sonson0910/moderntensor/blob/main/moderntensor.png)

## Existing Features

- **Convenient CLI**: Provides concise commands for easy interaction.
- **Scalability**: Supports the integration of additional libraries and tools in the future.
- **Flexible design**: Allows customization and configuration through setup files (config).

## Development Roadmap

1. **Alpha Version**  
   - Complete basic operations and the structure of the CLI.  
   - Provide initial usage documentation.

2. **Beta Version**  
   - Optimize performance and support cross-platform usage.  
   - Add additional libraries and plugins.

3. **Stable Release**  
   - Improve stability and enhance security.  
   - Provide deeper support for machine learning models and algorithms.

## Installation Requirements

- **Python** (version 3.9 or higher)
- Virtual environment **virtualenv** or **conda** (recommended)
- **Git** (for cloning the project)

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the source code from the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonson0910/moderntensor.git
   cd moderntensor
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -e .
   ```
